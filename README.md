Welcome to the  ![DAVit](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8759293?s=20&u=80214f09c8a6f5a219c40a62af483e694cb6fed8&v=4)DavitTec **FileIT** repository.

**:wrench: WARNING** Work in progress, there needs a few changes and fixes in the TEST Folder.


Please read [WiKi](https://github.com/DavitTec/fileit/wiki) for background information.


There is nothing much here yet as useful Tools, except mini shell scripts to create some directories with some symbolic links. There is also spreadsheet tool to help customise your own scripts.

The big question is to decide on a base operating system, Linux, MacOS or Windows. The initial focus on the file system structure may be Linux.

We may consider some from home office or Sole trader, micro business, small to SMEs [Case Studies](https://github.com/DavitTec/fileit/wiki/Case-Studies) to get us through from issues to analyses, problem solving and developing solutions.

Besides the systems and IT architecture, the main problem related to designing an information or record system is the business context. A business context model should identify all the actors (Government(s), people, organizations, systems, etc.) who play a significant role in the business process or in the specific activity domain. The complexity of the business context model relies on the initial size of the functional activities, interests relevant, and the scope of work, projects, and interactions with outside domains of the owner. In many cases, a Business Plan is usually developed and is the driving factor for most, if not all, business-related functions. We could assume in all cases a business planning scenario from a generic start-up, home office, or single operator/entrepreneur.


## Scripts & Spreadsheet

_Version 0.0.12_
The following are sample bash scripts to create a directory structure.
These can be amended or customised to your desire and create a new script
with the help of the included spreadsheet (FileIT.ods).

By changing the contents if the columns under the LEVEL1-6 will change the first
column that can be used to cut and paste into you own new bash script.

<mark>:exclamation:	WARNING </mark> ..    always check and test your script before deployment.


Spreadsheet download :
[fileIT.ods](https://github.com/DavitTec/FileIT/raw/master/src/fileIT.ods)

* **create-folders.sh** a generic first attempt of the typical directory structure.
* **smallbiz.sh** a directory structure for a typical small business.
