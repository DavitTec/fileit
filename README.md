Please read [WiKi](https://github.com/DavitTec/fileme/wiki) for background information. 


There is nothing much here yet as useful Tools, except a mini shell script to create some directories with some symbolic links.
The big question is to decide on a base operating system, Linux, MacOS or Windows. The initial focus on the file system structure may be Linux.

We may consider some from small to big [Case Studies](https://github.com/DavitTec/fileme/wiki/Case-Studies) to get us through from issues to analsys, problem solving and developing solutions.
