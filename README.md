# fileme



Welcome to the DavitTec fileme repository.

The purpose of this project is create system structure for single or multi user or electonic filing system for 
all kinds of data which needs appropriate list, read, write, delete access, searched, archived, categorised and retrieved.

The objective is to increase efficiency of filing and searching, reduce duplicates, increase ownership and versioning system.

To be methodological in for USER and System's heirachicial activity. 

However, many exsisting system flavours; Apple, Android, Google, Microsoft etc and the varied unixs and lnoxes, 
provide similar Default folders for the USER. 

But unadministered systems tend to follow the default FOLDER structures and usually get clottered, while the Admininisterd usually follow a custoimised structure 
to suit system architectures and the Admin protocols.  While assuming every user follows protocols.   

HERE, we present one option that maybe useful for both single or multi user/corporate. 

Can we develop a filing system protocol that is semi automatic and trasparent?

Ideally, in a multiuser environment, 
> duplications should be reduced

> digital asset (file/folder) may include orginality and validation with other metadata

> access for list, read, write or delele be flagged under protocol
